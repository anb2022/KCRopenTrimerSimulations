# KCRopenTrimerSimulations
Atomic-detail simulations of the dark and illuminated KCR trimers

This repository contains initial and final configurations of the three simulations of the KCR trimer as reported by Morizumi et al 2024. There are PDB coordinates for i) one simulation for the dark all-trans trimer; ii) two simulations for the illuminated 13-cis trimer. We additionally deposit here corresponding protein structure files (PSFs).
